1. Please keep in mind that files presented here are just for
demonstrations purposes only.  Do not follow bad programming
practices used in these samples files, esp. nothing is really
commented in a useful way.

2. As you may guess it, just type ./make.sh to compile all
sources files.  True Makefile development tool will be explained
later in this 2-Bin Unix course.
